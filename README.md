# VocalRec
VocalRec is an app that allows deaf people to read what someone is saying faster than ever before.

## How it works
VocalRec converts speech to text, allowing a deaf person to read what someone is saying.  Where VocalRec excels is in its ability to display the text in a way that allows the reader to read much faster.
